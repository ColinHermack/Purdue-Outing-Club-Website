# Components directory
Contains reusable TSX components which will be used elsewhere in the app. Reused components should always be written
here for easy modification (that is, components which will be shared across multiple files). Components that are used in
only one file should be written in the same directory as that file, either in the same file (for small components) or in
a separate file (for larger components).
