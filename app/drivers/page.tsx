        Samba Safety.

      <p className="max-w-[600px] text-center">
        On the second page of the form, you will be asked for additional
        information about the organization. Use this template as a guide to
        complete that part of the form. Be sure to include your respective
        campus (PWL or PUI).

        Step 3: Become a certified driver
      </h2>
      <p className="text-center max-w-[600px]">
        Once you&#39;ve completed both steps above, you will receive an email
        within a few days indicating whether you were approved to drive on
        Outing Club trips or not. As long as you complete the above steps
        properly and have a valid US driver&#39;s license, you will be approved.
        Once you are an approved driver, you are more likely to be selected for
        trips since two certified drivers are needed in every car on all
        official club trips.
