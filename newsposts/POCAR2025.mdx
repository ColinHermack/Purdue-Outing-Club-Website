## Recap

I hope you've gotten some good post-POCAR rest and enjoyed sleeping indoors again. I know I definitely did (although I 
do miss my lovely tent mates/co-coordinators/sardine can car sleepers).

I want to start off by thanking all the racers this year! We had a total of 55 teams with approximately 310 racers this 
year making this a massive POCAR. We really appreciate all of you for deciding to put yourselves through something so 
crazy, sometimes year after year. I have the utmost respect for anyone wild enough to give it a go no matter how far 
you made it. We certainly hope to see you back again for many years to come!

I want to also thank all the incredible volunteers we had this year. We had around 70 volunteers from the Purdue Outing 
Club working the Fire/Water stations and HQ, riding along in patrols, setting points, and taking them back down, as well 
as doing whatever other random tasks popped up. Helping us coordinators run HQ were former POCAR coordinators
Andrew Harrison, Audrey Robb, and Keaton Brown, so if you've raced the past several years you may have recognized them 
from that. Without them, we coordinators would have been much more sleep deprived than we already were out there. On 
top of that, we had the help of Matthew Bechdol and his crew of radio experts to maintain communication between all our 
checkpoints and different groups. All these different groups of volunteers come together each year to make this race 
happen and without all of them we couldn't make it happen, so thank you.

Thank you to Morgan-Monroe State Forest for letting us hold it there! I know this wasn't the originally planned location 
but I appreciate everyone being flexible with the location change!

Finally, thank you to my co-coordinators, Sarina Oliveri Kuhnle and Steven La Croix, for all the time and effort you put 
into putting this race together with me. I'm very grateful to have had such a wonderful team to work with. Love you two!

The energy at POCAR this year from both racers and volunteers was so fun and I was very glad to see how everyone 
maintained good spirits despite the difficulty of the weather and many teams having to drop out. 

In all, six teams finished, eighteen teams dropped out somewhere in Leg 3, nineteen teams dropped out somewhere in Leg 
2, and seventeen teams dropped out somewhere in Leg 1.
