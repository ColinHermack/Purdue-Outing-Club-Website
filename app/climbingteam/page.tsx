        The Purdue Climbing Team is a group of climbers of any skill level who
        train together and compete in both bouldering and ropes climbing
        competitions in the US collegiate circuit.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 text-center max-w-[800px]">
        We have won a divisional championship, received many individual podium
        placements and wins, and have even sent many climbers to the national
        championships.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4 text-center max-w-[800px]">
        If you like climbing, want to be part of a team that is dedicated to
        improving, and want to attend fun competitions around the US, you should
