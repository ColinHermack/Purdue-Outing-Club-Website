The Purdue Outing Club is a large student-run organization at Purdue that hosts outdoor trips. We began this project
early this year with the goal of streamlining the software systems that the club is using and to save money by
developing our own software in order to reduce reliance on services like Squarespace. 

The result was a full-stack application that manages member and trip data, and provides a forward-facing website for
the club. 

The frontend of the site is written using a combination of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and React for the more complex pages.
The backend is written entirely in JS using Express.
