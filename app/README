# App Directory
The app directory lays out the website page structure on any NextJS project.

## Homepage
The app directory contains source code for the website homepage in 
`app/page.tsx` and `app/layout.tsx`.

## page.tsx Files
This directory, and each subdirectory (including nested subdirectories) contains a page.tsx file. This is the React
source code for that page of the website. For example, `app/calendar` contains source code 
for [www.purdueoutingclub.com/calendar](www.purdueoutingclub.com/calendar).

## layout.tsx Files
Some directories also contain layout.tsx files. These are similar to page.tsx, but the page information they contain 
will be inherited by all nested pages. For example `app/layout.tsx` contains source code for the header and footer 
which are shared by all pages of this site.

## API Directory
The `route.ts` files in the `api` directory do not serve TSX, but rather JSON objects. This is how REST APIs are handled
in NextJS.
