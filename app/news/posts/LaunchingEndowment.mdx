The Purdue Outing Club was once known for mountaineering and outdoor climbing expeditions, but as the price of insurance
has risen these have unfortunately become a thing of the past.

The POC is launching an endowment with the goal of raising $12,500 in six months in order to bring back these lost
sports.
