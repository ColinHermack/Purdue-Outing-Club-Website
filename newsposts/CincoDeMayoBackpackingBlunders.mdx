The day looked ripe and hopes were high for a backpacking trip to close the semester. Reality kicked in as the soup tumbled to the ground, its delicious calories laid to waste across the gravel. And so, soupless, our trek began. Dry and comfortable, the rain quickly poured down on us for a nice cool shower. Then it began to pour so rain jackets went on, and the showers ceased. After much traveling we made it to our campsite. The tents went up and 3 liters of apple juice consumed. Eric peed 3 times that hour. With more rain on the way we gathered in the tent to play some cards when the water began to drip down onto the ground. Leaking so poorly, the tent known as the B.O. Bungalow or simply "The BOB" was deemed useless and we packed up and checked out after staying only a couple hours. The remaining three miles were a rough, unkept trail. Lots of mud and fallen trees blocked our path but alas we found the road in the darkness and made it back to the cars. Sodden and exhausted, we arrived to a place of recompense for all the worlds woes, the international house of pancakes. Copious sweet, empty calories were consumed, rejuvenating our tired spirits. At last we arrived to Purdue and slipped into the sweet food coma of rest to end a day well traveled. And thus our blunder fades into fond memory of flapjacks, rough trails, wet socks and 2.7 liters of apple juice.
