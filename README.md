# Public Directory
Contains publicly accessible files which are linked elsewhere in the application. Much like the app directory,
this is a routable directory. Unlike the app directory, all files in this directory are routable (meaning that this
README file can be accessed at [www.purdueoutingclub.com/README](www.purdueoutingclub.com/README))
