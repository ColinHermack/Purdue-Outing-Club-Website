The day is Friday, October 2nd, year two zero two zero, It is an hour past noon, our dear friend the gear closet had not been visited in over 6 months, today we got to see her once again. Our main objective today was to take back the trike for the good of clubkind, as the trike had been lonely in the gear closet without anyone to ride it :(. We had placed the trike in the closet last spring in order to repair it, and after successfully kind of repairing it, it became quarantined in the closet after march. And after 6 months and 18 days of planning our great heist to get it back, today was the day.

Joe, Hagan, Max and I put on our facemasks and stormed into the closet (with permission). We scoped out our gear and found the beauty that is the trike. We went about our usual gear closet buisness of preparing to inventory for the semester, but afterwards it was go time. We left at 12:45 and headed for the elevator that would lead us to the loading doc and loaded the trike in. We split up into groups of 2, Hagan and I would exit the loading doc and Joe and Max would exit through the stairwell. I pressed the L button on the elevator, swiftly exited the doors and walked down the stairs. As I sat down, and rode off into the sunset that was 1pm, I felt a sense of freedom as our friend the trike had been released from the walls of the corec and back out into the world. We rode our good friend home with a bicycle escort to accompany it.
